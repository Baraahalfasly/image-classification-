Image Classification with Pytorch


This code classifies an image using a pre-trained ResNet50 model on ImageNet data. It begins by loading the model in evaluation mode. Then, it checks if the image exists at the specified path, loads it, and applies preprocessing steps (resizing, cropping, converting to a tensor, and normalization). After that, it feeds the image into the model to get the output. It checks for the existence of the class labels file, loads it, then extracts the predicted class and prints the result based on the highest predicted value.
